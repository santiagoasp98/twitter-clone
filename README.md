# Twitter Clone

This project is a simple clone of Twitter, created for the purpose of practicing and learning new technologies. It's a full-stack application with a backend built with NestJS and a frontend built with React.

## Why a Twitter Clone?

Building a Twitter clone provides a great opportunity to learn and practice various aspects of web development, from user authentication and real-time updates to handling and displaying user-generated content. It's a complex enough project to be challenging and educational, but not so complex as to be overwhelming.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Frontend**: React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Database**: MongoDB, a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- **Styling**: Material-UI, a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design.
